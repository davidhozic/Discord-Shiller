.. tab:: PyCord

    This framework uses a Discord API wrapper called PyCord and it is built to allow working directly with Pycord (eg. framework objects accept Pycord objects as arguments).

Key features
-------------------
- Periodic advertisement to **Direct (Private) Messages**, **Text channels** and **Voice channels**
- Advertising with either static data (text, embed, files, audio) or **dynamic data** (the data is obtained thru a function dynamically)
- Logging of send attempts with **JSON** file logs or to a **SQL** server (Microsoft SQL Server only).
- Ability to add additional application layers with help of asyncio
- Easy to setup
- Ability to run on **user** accounts or **bot** accounts

.. warning::
    While running this on user accounts is possible, it is not recommended since it is against Discord's ToS.
